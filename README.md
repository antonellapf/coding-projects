# Project 1: Finding Nemo Text Adventure Game 

Description: In this project, I have undertaken the exciting challenge of designing a 
captivating text-based adventure game using the power of Python. 
"Finding Nemo Text Adventure Game" brings the beloved movie to life in a captivating
text-based adventure. As the main character, Nemo, players explore the Great Barrier Reef, 
encountering familiar characters and facing thrilling challenges.

Key Features:
Features and functions - Project 1: Strings and String Manipulation, User-Defined Functions and Objects (variables),User Input and Input Handling
Conditional and Nested Conditional Statements (if/elif/else), Loops (for/while), Controlling for Errors (try/except)

# Project 2: Regression Analysis

Description: In this individual project, I have built a regression model. The goal is to 
predict the revenue generated by the company using various features. The project involved 
feature engineering, model preparation, variable selection, and model development.

Features and functions - Project 2: Training Score, Testing Score, Train-Test Gap
This included exploratory data analysis, where I gained insights and identified patterns in the dataset.
I then performed feature engineering to enhance the predictive power of the model and test different models.

This project demonstrates my skills in regression analysis, feature engineering, and model development, 
contributing to my portfolio in data science and predictive modeling.
