    "# Welcome to the \"Finding Nemo Text Adventure Game!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This game is based on the movie Finding Nemo, in which you will be located around the Great Barrier Reef playing as the main character: Nemo and trying to find a way to return home. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You will try to escape some different scenes or complete tasks to level-up and reach the next level. According to where you are in the game you will have different options to step to another level and keep playing, or to lose. Be wise in your answers and follow your intuition. While swimming you will meet characters from the movie, such as Squirt, a young marine turtle, or Bruce a big and scary shark.\n",

    "I am sure you will do great, and Don't worry you will have an option to start all over again if that is the case.\n",

    "Do your best and good luck!\n",
